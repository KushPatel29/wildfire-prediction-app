"""
Write the Power BI project from the specs in this package.

A PBIR report is one JSON file per visual, and this one has seventy-odd of
them. Typing those by hand is how a report ends up carrying three different
``visualContainer`` schema versions, a property name Desktop silently drops on
the next save, and no way to check either -- Power BI treats a bad property as
an empty visual rather than an error, so a broken report looks finished.

So the report is generated from :mod:`powerbi.report_spec`, the model from
:mod:`powerbi.model_spec`, and both are committed. ``--check`` regenerates into
a temporary directory and diffs, so CI fails if the committed project and the
spec have drifted apart.

Column types come from the CSVs themselves rather than from a list kept by
hand. That is not tidiness: a column bound in the M query but left out of
``Table.TransformColumnTypes`` arrives as **text**, still binds, still renders,
and sorts alphabetically -- and any measure multiplying it fails at query time
with Power BI's generic "this might be caused by a capacity or license issue".

Usage::

    python -m powerbi.build_pbip
    python -m powerbi.build_pbip --check
